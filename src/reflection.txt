## Elapsed duration
I chose dt to match the time between between 2 consective calls to onMessage() functions.
Because I am not sure if the time of the simulator match the time of the computer,
instead of using computer time to measure the duration, I use distance of travel divided by
current speed, as both of them are measured by the simulator

The elapsed time seems to depend on the computer. On my laptop it is about 120ms but on my
desktop it is about 70ms. In the current code I chose 70ms a the elapsed duration


## Timestep length
The timestep length is chosen to be large to cover enough distance in the future so that the
control has more information to optimize. However it should not be too far ahead for two reasons.
First, the track is approximated, the further away, the less accurate the approximation is, leading
to wrong optimization. Secondly, looking too far ahead put more weigh in optimizing future driving 
instead of current driving, but the objective is to find the current actuators, and future actuators
should be better handled by future optimization when more accurate information is available.

When I tried large N (N = 50), MPC looks to far ahead and at times approximate the track inaccurately
at furthest part, in other times, match the track too close at the further part at the cost of large cte
in the closest portion of the track.

WHen I tried small N (N=5 to 10), MPC does not have enough information, creating a lot swings when driving
as the optimization change drastically from one step to the next.

In the end I chose N to be around 20 to 30.


## Latency
In addtition to the "artificial" latency of 100ms that the code generated, there seems to be an inherent
latency in the simulator with duration of around 150ms (I found this value by vary the latency and see 
which one generates best driving performance). So in total, I adjusted for 250ms of latency.

To deal with latency, I simulate, using the kinetic model, the states of the vehicle after the duration
of the latency, and use these states to be the initial states for the MPC.
